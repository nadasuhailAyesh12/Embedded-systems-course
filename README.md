## Lab Highlights

### Lab 1: Button-Controlled LEDs
- **Objective**: Control four LEDs (connected to PORT2) using two buttons (connected to PORT0).
- **Key Features**:
  - Button 1 turns on all LEDs.
  - Button 2 turns off all LEDs.
- **Simulation**: Provided in the report with screenshots and video links.

### Lab 2: Seven-Segment Counter
- **Objective**: Create a decrementing counter displayed on a seven-segment display with a red LED indicator.
- **Key Features**:
  - Counter decrements from 555 to 000.
  - Red LED lights up when the counter reaches 0.
- **Simulation**: Includes simulation results with detailed explanation in the report.
